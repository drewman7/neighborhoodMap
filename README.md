Instructions
------------

Start:
Open up the web page.

Finding your Address/Neighborhood:
In the 'Input an Address' box, enter an address and click the 'Click Me' button.  Note, this can be an address, city, state, country, etc. The Google Map will take you to the address/neighborhood you entered above.  Wikipedia articles matching your address/neighborhood will appear in the Wikipedia Articles section (underneath the map).

Adding Markers/Categories to the Map:
Go the 'Enter a marker category (ex. pizza):' input box and enter your category, location, store, marker, etc.  Examples: pizza, steak, store, fire department, school, etc.  Then click 'Add Markers'.  This will add the markers to map (push pins) and provide a list below.  Each marker search will add 20 markers to the map and the list.

Remove All:
If at any time you want to clear the list and map of markers, just click on the 'Remove All' button.

Filter the Markers:
If you want to filter the list, go to the 'Filter List' input box and start typing your filter.  The list and the map will automatically start updating to show only markers that match your filter criteria.

Click a Marker:
The markers in the list are clickable.  If you click one, the map will zero in on that marker and an infowindow with the nmarker name will appear.  Also, a Wikipedia article search will show any results in the Wikipedia article section (next to or under the marker list).

Wikipedia Article Section:
As noted above, Wikipedia articles are provided when an address/neighborhood is searched or when a marker is click in the marker list.  Some locations and markers do not have articles in Wikipedia.  The section will tell you if no articles were found.
